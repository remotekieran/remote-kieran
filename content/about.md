I'm a writer and product marketer currently helping to grow <a href="https://www.ably.io" target="_blank">Ably</a> - a realtime API and cloud infrastructure provider. We recently closed our Series A ü•≥.

I work closely with engineering and product teams, as well as with senior management. I'm no coder or designer but I have enough technical knowledge to be dangerous in a GitHub repo, I know what constitutes good UX, and I'm fascinated by all things tech.

## My early professional life

I cut my marketing teeth writing freelance copy during my undergraduate degree for beer and travel money. Web copy, blog posts, drip-feed emails, and the like.

I went on to work as a copywriter at a marketing and communicatons <a href="http://pyramidion.be" target="_blank">agency</a> in Antwerp, leading on high tech industrial briefs for the likes of DNV GL, NXP, and Phillips. I learned a great deal here. My copy was critiqued on a daily basis by writers with decades of experience and that helped hone my copy and style. I was taught a framework and process for devising positioning and messaging with meaning. And I learned to work at a fast pace while maintaining a high standard of work.

## Fully-funded masters? OK.

The opportunity to study a fully-funded MSc in Marketing came my way and, not one to turn down a free lunch, I jumped back into education and freelance copywritring. My MSc focused on product and marketing as a strategic function of a company. My thesis explored the increasing number of touchpoints consumers experience in an omnichannel environment. A year later, my masters done, I headed back to tech as a writer and product marketer at early stage startups.

But I'd tasted travel and didn't want to give it up. Luckily for me, remote working is a thing now.

## Digital nomadding

I took off for Asia, building on my existing freelance client base and starting my own consultancy. For 18 months I provided a full suite of marketing and communications work from high-level strategy and market research to messaging and content creation. Clients included Birmingham City University, Nottingham Trent University, and TedX Brum. I travelled extensively during this time. Eventually, wanting to do something with a larger team in tech, I sought a new role.

For the next two years I headed up product marketing at a big data and analytics <a href="https://weared4.com" target="_blank">software studio</a>, where I led three SaaS products to market that focused on helping people <a href="https://prodlytic.com" target="_blank">collect</a>, <a href="https://querytreeapp.com" target="_blank">report on</a>, and <a href="https://sqlizer.io" target="_blank">migrate</a> data. With the freedom I was given I increased website visits and sign ups by 30%, [10xed MRR](/work/maximising-revenue/), and led a beta and product launch for a [ SaaS product](/work/new-saas/).

I was also lucky enough to experience a truly remote-first work culture here. I cotinued to travel to <a href="https://nomadlist.com/@kks" target="_blank">new places</a> every few months with the freedom that culture gave me. I sometimes wrote about the <a href="/blog/remote-company-culture/">life of remote work</a>. I learned a great deal about working in a remote cross-functional, motivating myself on a daily basis, and overcoming the limitations of remote work with clear communication.

## Now

Nowadays I'm a product marketer at [Ably](https://www.ably.io). I live in East London, riding up and down Regent's Canal when the weather permits. I take pictures of buildings and people. I think and write about APIs, software products, and markets.
