I'm a writer and marketer currently helping to grow [Ably Realtime](https://ably.io) in London.

I cut my marketing teeth writing freelance copy during my undergraduate degree for beer and travel money. I went on to work as a copywriter at a marketing and communicatons <a href="http://pyramidion.be" target="_blank">agency</a> in Antwerp. Here I worked on high tech industrial briefs for the likes of DNV GL, NXP, and Phillips.

The chance to study a fully-funded MSc in Marketing appeared and, not one to turn down an opportunity, I jumped back into education. My MSc focused on product and marketing as a strategic function of a company.

A year later, my masters done, I headed back to tech as a writer and product marketer at early stage startups. But I'd tasted travel and didn't want to give it up. Luckily for me, remote working is a thing now.

I've worked closely with engineering and product teams, as well as with senior management. I'm no coder or designer but I understand the internet, what constitutes good UX, and I'm fascinated by all things tech.

For two years I headed up product marketing at a big data and analytics <a href="https://weared4.com" target="_blank">software studio</a>, where I led three SaaS products to market that focused on helping people <a href="https://prodlytic.com" target="_blank">collect</a>, <a href="https://querytreeapp.com" target="_blank">report</a>, and <a href="https://sqlizer.io" target="_blank">migrate</a> data.

I chose to travel to new places every few months with the freedom that a remote-first work culture gave me. I sometimes wrote about the <a href="https://medium.com/initialcommit/why-company-culture-makes-or-breaks-remote-work-59c257ae4673" target="_blank">life of remote work</a>.

Nowadays I live in East London, riding up and down Regent's Canal when the weather permits. I take pictures of buildings and people. I think and write about software products and markets.
