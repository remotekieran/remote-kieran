In 2015 during my stint as a Copywriter at an Antwerp [marketing and communications agency](http://pyramidion.be), I positioned a new global company. [WeEn](http://www.ween-semi.com), a joint venture between [NXP Semiconductors](https://www.nxp.com) and Beijing-based [JAC Capital](http://www.jaccapital.cn/en/), was to bridge the gap between the Asian and European bipolar semiconductor markets.

> My task: put WeEn in a position to gain substantial market share in its early years.

I produced comprehensive positioning that informed people across WeEn, from C-level executives to marketing managers, of it's position in the market, helping to align strategic and operational activities at all levels.

## Process and outcomes

The agency, with over 25 years experience positioning products, had an excellent process for positioning products. So my own workflow followed this methodology closely, resulting in a strategic positioning document with the following strucutre and content:

* Current position review
  * Who is WeEn?
  * SWOT analysis
  * Marketing mix (7 Ps)

* Current state of the global market
  * Market growth for the last three years
  * Biggest and smallest segments of the market
  * Established players
* Three-year market projection
  * Compiled using existing industry reports and projections
* Competitive analysis
  * Portfolio comparison of the top fifteen companies
  * SWOT analyses of the top fifteen companies
  * Messaging overview of the top five players

* Target audience
  * Problem-focused user personas based on interviews with engineers, designers, and manufacturers
* Value proposition
  * Combining the conclusions and findings of the above into a value proposition that people across WeEn can use to inform their strategic and tactical activities
* Positioning statement
  * A single statement that sums up the position of WeEn

Today, three years after crafting WeEn's positioning, you can still find the positioning statement [front and center](http://www.ween-semi.com/about.aspx):
