      <description>Scam or the future? No matter what you think of blockchains and cryptocurrencies it&amp;rsquo;s where you&amp;rsquo;ll find the hype in tech right now. If you&amp;rsquo;ve got the expertise there&amp;rsquo;s money to be made and interesting challenges to overcome. My client had the technical chops needed to jump on the blockchain hype train. Choo choo! ðŸš‚
This is a risky market though. My client wanted to insulate itself from market volatility as much as possible.</description>

      <description>After a repositioning and double price raise growth had become stagnant for this SaaS product. The low-hanging marketing fruit was eaten and I was working on growth with long-term channels. Long overdue some love from the product team, we set out to find what the product was missing in the eyes of customers and the market.
Step 1: customer research ðŸ‘€ The product has a diverse set of customers: regular free users, irregular one-off users, regular weekly users, heavy daily users.</description>

      <description>The software studio I was working for was trying to move from client revenue to product revenue. The Directors wanted to build a product analytics tool. Problems faced by clients had led them to believe there was a gap in the market.
 I was responsible for defining the requirements for an analytics product as set by the market, devising the go-to-market strategy, and driving initial growth.
 Process I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a five-part process for an end-to-end project like this:</description>

      <description>In January 2017 I accepted a product marketing role at a small software studio. The studio wanted to transition from client revenue to product revenue. It already had two products in the market but they were only bringing in a small percentage of revenue.
One of these products had rapidly gained users, seemingly finding product-market-fit in no time. It helped solve a well-defined problem: turning files (CSV, Excel, JSON) into SQL databases.</description>

      <description>In 2015 during my stint as a Copywriter at an Antwerp marketing and communications agency, I positioned a new global company. WeEn, a joint venture between NXP Semiconductors and Beijing-based JAC Capital, was to bridge the gap between the Asian and European bipolar semiconductor markets.
 My task: put WeEn in a position to gain substantial market share in its early years.
 I produced comprehensive positioning that informed people across WeEn, from C-level executives to marketing managers, of it&amp;rsquo;s position in the market, helping to align strategic and operational activities at all levels.</description>

      <description>In 2015 I was a Copywriter at a marketing and communications agency in Antwerp. They&amp;rsquo;re experts at helping high-tech indsustrial giants differentiate themselves and their products in an increasingly competitive global marketplace. One of my favourite projects was the Dialog DA15100 worldwide product launch.
Dialog Semiconductor, with revenues exceeding $1.3BN, powers the smart connected world by designing and building the semiconductors (or &amp;lsquo;chips&amp;rsquo;) found in all sorts of industrial and consumer electronics.</description>
