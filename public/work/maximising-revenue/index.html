<body><div class="wrap"><div class="section" id="title">Maximising revenue while enhancing customer value</div><div class="section" id="content">

<p>In January 2017 I accepted a product marketing role at a small <a href="https://weared4.com">software studio</a>. The studio wanted to transition from client revenue to product revenue. It already had two products in the market but they were only bringing in a small percentage of revenue.</p>

<p>One of these <a href="https://sqlizer.io">products</a> had rapidly gained users, seemingly finding product-market-fit in no time. It helped solve a well-defined problem: turning files (CSV, Excel, JSON) into SQL databases. The product had thousands of daily users and had organically made it to the top three Google spots for ~10 search terms. But revenue was tiny.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My task was to find out why revenue was so low despite thousands of users and do something about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="research-finds-a-lack-of-market-position">Research finds a lack of market position</h2>

<p>As usual I started with market research. I found a handful of other products offering similiar, if not exactly the same, service. What stood out was:</p>

<ul>
<li>None of these products had defined positions in the market, including the one I was trying to grow</li>
<li>Competing tools would&rsquo;ve looked right at home on a Windows 95 computer and some even required you to download their software
<img src="/images/work/max-revenue/ui.png"></li>
<li>Competitors had problems with privacy and security - many convert your file and then publish their contents for the world to see</li>
<li>Only a tiny portion were charging customers</li>
<li>Tools ranged from too simple to too complex</li>
</ul>

<p>I realised my product didn&rsquo;t have a defined market position but had carved one out for itself: letting you easily convert your file to a SQL database. There was an opportunity to strengthen this position.</p>

<h2 id="talking-to-customers">Talking to customers</h2>

<p>The product had thousands of free and tens of paying customers. I talked with willing users from both groups and asked them:</p>

<ul>
<li>How often do you use the product?</li>
<li>What does the product help you do?</li>
<li>Why do you / don&rsquo;t you pay for the product?</li>
<li>Why did you choose the product over competitors?</li>
<li>How would you complete your task if the product disappeared tomorrow?</li>
</ul>

<p>Five things emerged from customer research:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pricing could be improved</li>
<li>Privacy and security were important</li>
<li>The product solved multiple problems</li>
<li>Larger file conversion sizes than competitors was great</li>
<li>The user-friendly UI made an otherwise fiddly task easy</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>I concluded that there was an opportunity to create a strong market position around security, privacy, and a superior user experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-paywall-doesn-t-equal-revenue">A paywall doesn&rsquo;t equal revenue</h2>

<p>At the time the product had a generous free tier (which free users loved) with a single (low priced) monthly subscription option. If someone tried to convert a file that was too large they hit a paywall. Despite thousands of daily users hardly anyone was paying.</p>

<p>Customer research had unearthed an inadequate pricing strategy so I took a deeper look at the analytics data I had and found:</p>

<ul>
<li>Large numbers of people hitting the paywall but a conversion rate of less than 1%</li>
<li>Healthy visits to the sign up page (different from the paywall) but conversion of less than 1%</li>
<li>Of those customers who did pay, monthly churn rates were huge because people were paying once and cancelling before renewal</li>
<li>A humungous dropoff of file conversion at the top of the free allowance, suggesting reducing the free conversion allowance wouldn&rsquo;t make any difference to revenue because people would simply chop up their files to the new free limit and convert multiple ones, which was what was already happening</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on the analytics data and the multiple jobs I&rsquo;d created from customer research, I concluded that our current pricing structure wasn&rsquo;t serving our customers and their diverse use cases.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="forming-a-hypothesis-and-increasing-revenue">Forming a hypothesis and increasing revenue</h2>

<p>It was clear the product needed a new pricing structure. I hypothesised that we could add a 24 hour pass and an annual tier while raising prices and boosting conversion rates. The new pricing structure:</p>

<ul>
<li>24-hour pass (same price as the original monthly subscription fee)</li>
<li>Monthly subscription (double the original price but grandfathering in existing users)</li>
<li>Annual subscription (save 20% on month-on-month subscription)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Two hours after the new pricing was live someone bought a 24h pass. Three hours later someone purchased a monthly subscription.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a month it was clear the new pricing was a hit:</p>

<ul>
<li>24h purchases increased conversion rate upon hitting the paywall by 40%</li>
<li>Monthly subscriptions increased by 20%</li>
<li>Multiple annual subscriptions were purchased</li>
</ul>

<p>After three months of consecutive revenue growth across all pricing tiers I believed prices could be raised again. Growth was strong enough to suggest the pricing structure was correct and could withstand a pricing change.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The goal now was to find the price ceiling without changing positioning or building out the product.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After asking willing users <em>&ldquo;how much would you pay each month/24h period to keep using this product?&rdquo;</em> every tier was doubled.</p>

<p>After another three months of consecutive, but slower, growth I again believed prices could be raised. But I was more conservative as I believed the product was reaching the price ceiling for its current positioning and product offering.</p>

<p>Prices were raised by 50%. Over three months user growth retracted slightly. But overall revenue was higher. The price ceiling had been reached.</p>

<p>By creating a strong market position and changing pricing to offer more value to customers I successfully 10xed MRR.</p>
