If you&amp;rsquo;ve got the expertise there&amp;rsquo;s money to be made and interesting challenges to overcome. My client had the technical chops needed to jump on the blockchain hype train. Choo choo! ðŸš‚
This is a risky market though. My client wanted to insulate itself from market volatility as much as possible.</description>

      <description>The software studio I was working for was trying to move from client revenue to product revenue. The Directors wanted to build a product analytics tool. Problems faced by clients had led them to believe there was a gap in the market.
