      <description>I spent the last six months working six time zones ahead of the six people on my team. I’ve always put travel as a top priority so I took advantage of my travel-friendly work setup to spend time in Asia.

&amp;nbsp;
Ninety percent of the world&amp;rsquo;s data was created in the last two years. That&amp;rsquo;s 2.5 quadrillion bytes of data. For reference, the whole of Wikipedia takes up approximately 45GB of storage - less storage than the cheapest iPhone 8 ships with. As time goes on the amount of data and the rate of generation is only going to increase as more &amp;lsquo;things&amp;rsquo; connect to the internet.</description>
